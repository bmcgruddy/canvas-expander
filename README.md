# Canvas Expander
A [krita](https://krita.org/) extension that supplies helpful canvas related operations to help speed up workflow.

## Features

### Canvas resizing Tools

- **Default**; like a pseudo infinite canvas!
- **Current Layer**; its "Trim To Current Layer" minus the destructive "trimming".
- **Paint Layers**; as above instead it fits to all paint layers.
- **Viewport**; to be used as a non destructive cropping tool.
- **Selection**; to be used as a non destructive cropping tool.
- **Scale To Zoom**; (*destructive*) dynamically re-scale the document based on current zoom making it now 100% zoom.

> Note:
> The most of these operations are non destructive and none of the layer data is changed, it changes the document dimensions that frames them.

### Layer Tools

- **Toggle Layer Visibility By Color**; almost limitless with posibilites! turn sketch, filter, background layers on or off at the press of a button.
> Note:
> The toggle averages all layers of that color's visibility state then sets the opposite of that. This is to help keep unity state of said color group.
