# Canvas Expander
A krita extension that supplies helpful canvas related operations to help speed up workflow.

## Features

 - Resize the document to fit all paint layers and viewport bounds, With options for just the layers or just the selected layer.

	 *Note that this does not trim the layers unlile 'trim to selection'.*
	 *The main utility of this function is to have something akin to mypaints infinite canvas.*

 - Scale the document to zoom, dynamically re-scale the document based on current zoom making it now 100% zoom. Its 'Scale Image To New size...' without the menus!
	 *Note: this is a destructive operation *
